PROBLEM STATEMENT

The Art of Living Foundation (AOLF) is a non-profit, educational and humanitarian organization, operating in 152 countries, founded in 1981 by the world-renown philanthropist and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.

There are several sub-organizations under the Art of Living Foundation, including International Association for Human Values (IAHV), Volunteer for a Better India (VBI), Vyakti Vikas Kendra (VVK), Sri Sri Rural Development Program (SSRDP), Art of Living Health & Education Trust (AOLHET), Youth Leadership Training Program (YLTP) etc.

Currently there are approx. 300 active projects that are 100% volunteer driven, making a positive impact in the areas of rural health, child education, sustainable farming, rejuvenating dried-up rivers, electoral reforms and fighting human trafficking.

Many volunteers are looking to contribute their time, talent, or money for rebuilding India, but, selecting the right project to engage is a challenge. They need to scour through hundreds of projects and will have no idea where to start. The goal is to make it easy for a volunteer to be able to explore service opportunities where they would be most comfortable, based on their preferences and past experiences with service projects.



PROPOSED SOLUTION

The idea is to create a very simple volunteer-facing app, that lists a good selection (a few 100 projects). Essentially, the need is to build a recommendation system for projects v/s volunteers. So, based on their profile and preferences as well as past experiences (that are documented at the end of each service experience via a survey, etc.), a training model can be constructed and an appropriate learning algorithm should be able to suggest what project would be the most appropriate project for the volunteer to go to next. This way interested volunteers can select the most appropriate project (for them) from the portfolio of projects in India and connect with the right teams and be a changemaker.

This project may be reused for other use-cases where recommendation systems are needed.
